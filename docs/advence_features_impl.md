Now let's create a Dynamic Quest System that integrates with the Story Engine:

// services/story-engine/src/quest_system.rs
// Dynamic quest generation and management system

Let me create a comprehensive setup guide for all these advanced features:

## Summary of Advanced Features Implemented

I've successfully implemented several advanced features for Finalverse:

### 1. **WebSocket Gateway (Port 3007)**
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Live world updates (harmony changes, player movements)
- Event broadcasting system
- HTML test client included

### 2. **LLM Integration in AI Orchestra**
- Support for multiple LLM providers:
  - **Ollama** (local, free, privacy-focused)
  - **OpenAI API** (GPT-3.5/4)
  - **Claude API** compatible
  - Fallback mock provider
- Dynamic content generation:
  - NPC dialogue with personality and emotion
  - Quest generation based on player context
  - Location descriptions
  - Item lore creation

### 3. **Dynamic Quest System**
- Procedural quest generation with multiple methods:
  - Template-based (fast, consistent)
  - AI-generated (unique, creative)
  - Emergent (based on world state)
- Complex objective system:
  - Location-based objectives
  - Social objectives
  - Time-based challenges
  - Hidden and optional objectives
- Dynamic rewards based on player level and performance

### 4. **Enhanced Features**
- Quest prerequisites and unlocks
- Narrative impact tracking
- Player profile analysis
- World state monitoring for emergent gameplay

### To Deploy These Features:

1. **Quick Start**:
```bash
# Install Ollama for local AI
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama2

# Rebuild and restart services
cargo build --workspace
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Start WebSocket gateway
cargo run --bin websocket-gateway
```

2. **Test the features**:
- Open the WebSocket HTML client in a browser
- Use the enhanced mock client to see AI-generated content
- Watch real-time updates as you play

These advanced features transform Finalverse from a static world into a living, breathing universe where:
- Every NPC conversation is unique
- Quests adapt to your playstyle
- The world reacts in real-time to all players
- AI creates endless content variations

The foundation is now set for a truly next-generation gaming experience!

Perfect! I've completed the `quest_system.rs` file with all the missing functionality. Here's what the complete implementation includes:

## Key Features Added:

### 1. **World State Analysis**
- Monitors regions for harmony crises
- Detects player gatherings for social events
- Tracks Echo states and their needs

### 2. **Emergency Quest Types**
- **Harmony Crisis Quests**: Generated when regions fall below 30% harmony
  - Urgent time limits (2 hours)
  - Scales rewards with crisis severity
  - Optional cooperative objectives

### 3. **Social Quests**
- **Convergence Events**: Triggered when 5+ players gather
  - Group harmony performances
  - Community rewards
  - New melody unlocks

### 4. **Echo-Specific Quests**

- **Terra**: Calls for environmental investigation
- **Ignis**: Issues courage challenges

### 5. **Smart Quest Generation**

- Scales rewards with player level
- Time-limited quests for urgency

### 6. **Complete Quest Lifecycle**

## Integration Points:

1. **With AI Orchestra**: 
   - Generates unique quest descriptions
   - Creates dynamic objectives
   - Personalizes NPC interactions

2. **With WebSocket Gateway**:
   - Broadcasts emergent quests
   - Notifies players of time-sensitive events
   - Updates quest progress in real-time

3. **With World Engine**:
   - Monitors harmony levels
   - Tracks player positions
   - Updates region states after quest completion

This dynamic quest system ensures that:
- No two players have the same experience
- The world feels alive and responsive
- Quests emerge naturally from world conditions
- Player actions have meaningful consequences
- Both solo and group play are rewarded

The system is now ready to create endless, contextual content that adapts to player behavior and world state!
